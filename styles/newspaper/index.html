            <h1>About This Design</h1>
            <p>
                Newspaper web designs have a distinct look that sets them apart from blogs, social media, and other informational websites.
                They face a tremendous challenge in showing huge amounts of information in limited screen sizes.
                Often, it can be overwhelming to peruse as the website balances the need to show all the highlights, links, and ads at once.

                    An article from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/newspaper-website-design-trends-and-examples/">
                    Smashing Magazine</a> explores the common trends of newspaper websites:
                </p>
            <div class="content__grid">

                <span class="content__griditem">
                     <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
                     <p>Most color schemes are plain, using dark text on a light background.
                     Contrast and readability is important, so plain color schemes are often used.</p>
                </span>
                <span class="content__griditem">
                     <h2>Header & Sidebar Banners</h2>
                     <p>Banners galore for generating revenue. They are inserted in headers, sidebars, contents, and footers.
                     </p>
                </span>
                <span class="content__griditem">
                     <h2>Multiple navigation bars</h2>
                     <p>Because of the amount of content, sites may use the sidebar and header or a two-level menu for navigation.</p>
                </span>
                <span class="content__griditem">
                     <h2>Tabbed content areas</h2>
                     <p>These areas allow for more content to be displayed while allowing the user to control what news they see.</p>
                </span>
                <span class="content__griditem">
                     <h2>Grid-based layouts</h2>
                     <p>This layout mimics traditional newspaper layout by organizing content into grids.
                     </p>
                </span>
